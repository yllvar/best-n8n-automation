# Advanced PDF and Document Processing with n8n Automation

## Making PDFs Actually Useful

Right, PDFs. The digital equivalent of a locked filing cabinet. They're everywhere, they contain everything important, and traditionally, getting information out of them is about as pleasant as dental surgery. But what if PDFs could actually... *talk*? What if you could extract data, analyze content, and process documents without wanting to throw your laptop out the window?

Well, now you can.

This repository contains what is possibly the most comprehensive collection of PDF and document processing templates... *in the world.* These aren't just file converters. These are AI-powered document intelligence systems that turn static PDFs into dynamic, queryable, processable data.

Some say these workflows can replace entire data entry departments. Some say they understand documents better than humans. All we know is... they're spectacularly effective.

## What This Collection Does

These workflows automate document processing tasks that would normally require:
- **Human eyeballs** - extracting information from PDFs and images using AI (no squinting required)
- **Human ears** - transcribing audio files and summarizing content (no rewinding necessary)
- **Human patience** - parsing invoices and resumes (no screaming allowed)
- **Human formatting skills** - converting HTML to Markdown (no manual editing needed)
- **Human data entry** - ETL pipelines for text processing (no soul-crushing repetition)

And much more. Basically, if it involves documents and tedious work, we've automated it.

## Setup Instructions: Making This Work

Right, here's what you actually need to do:

**1. Set up an n8n instance**
   - Self-hosted or cloud, your choice
   - Just make sure it's actually running

**2. Configure credentials**
   - AI models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Mistral—whatever the workflow needs)
   - APIs (Adobe, Google, Vertex AI—depends on the template)
   - Integration credentials (Notion, Airtable, Drive—you get the picture)

**3. Import workflow templates**
   - Download the JSON files
   - Import into n8n
   - Don't panic when you see how many nodes there are

**4. Follow specific instructions**
   - Each workflow has setup notes
   - Read them
   - Seriously, read them
   - Not reading them causes 97% of support questions

**5. Test before production**
   - Use test documents first
   - Make sure everything works
   - Then unleash on real data

**Pro Tip:** For detailed n8n setup, see the [n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/). It's actually good documentation, unlike most technical docs.
