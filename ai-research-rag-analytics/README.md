# Awesome n8n Templates Collection

## Right, Listen Very Carefully...

What we have here is possibly the most comprehensive collection of n8n workflows... *in the world.* This isn't just a repository. This is what happens when you give artificial intelligence access to everything and tell it to "sort things out."

Some say these workflows can automate anything. Some say they were built by robots. All we know is... they're in this repository.

## Usage: How to Actually Use This Stuff

Right, here's the simple bit:

1. **Import** the .json file into your n8n instance (they're in the 'json_files' subfolder, because organization)
2. **Configure** your credentials and settings (API keys go here, not in public repositories)
3. **Activate** the workflow (press the button, watch the magic)

Each workflow comes in both .txt and .json formats. The .txt is for reading. The .json is for doing. Don't mix them up.

## Requirements: What You'll Need

- An n8n instance (obviously)
- Relevant API credentials (OpenAI, Google, etc.) - and no, you can't use mine
- Required integrations and services (each workflow tells you what it needs)
- A basic understanding that AI isn't magic (though it's close)
- Patience (some workflows need configuration)

## Contributing: Making This Even Better

Feel free to contribute by:
1. **Adding new workflows** - if they're good enough
2. **Improving existing workflows** - there's always room for more speed
3. **Providing better documentation** - because clear instructions help everyone
4. **Reporting issues** - if something's broken, tell us before complaining on Twitter

Just don't submit workflows that don't actually work. We test these things.
