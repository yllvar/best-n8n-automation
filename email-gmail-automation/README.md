## Making Email Actually Bearable

Right, email. The digital equivalent of junk mail, except it arrives every three seconds and demands your immediate attention. Inbox Zero is a myth. Email bankruptcy is real. And traditional email management is about as effective as using a teaspoon to empty a swimming pool.

But what if email could actually... *manage itself*? What if AI could read, categorize, summarize, and even respond to your messages while you do literally anything else? What if your inbox worked for you instead of ruining your life?

Well, now it can.

This repository contains what is possibly the most advanced collection of email automation templates... *in the world.* These aren't just filters and rules. These are AI-powered email intelligence systems that turn your nightmare inbox into a well-oiled communication machine.

Some say these workflows can replace entire email teams. Some say they understand your inbox better than you do. All we know is... they're spectacularly effective at making email not terrible.
